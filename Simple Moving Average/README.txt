All the Documentation of my code I explained in my Report.
Here is the steps to run the source code.
1) unzip my project.
2) My project contains Dataset files for single host and map reduce.
3) For single host Java program :
	a) Goto SingleHostjava and import simplemovingaverage in your eclipse.
	b) which contains input.txt file inside project src folder.
	c) Now Run Calculate.java file.
	d) Enter window size
	e) you will get output according to window size in your console.
	f) i put two output files for window size 3 and 4 respectively in 
		SingleHostjava folder.
4) For Hadoop MapReduce :
	a) Goto Map-Reducejava/simplemovingaveragemap-reduce and import SimpleMovingAverage project in our virtual cloud eclipse.
	b) create input directory in hdfs and put my _user_vcslstudent_input0_sample.txt inside input directory.
	c) _user_vcslstudent_input0_sample.txt file is in Dataset for MapReduce folder.
	d) Now set the Run configuration in eclipse According to what professor mentioned in vcsl manual.
	e) Run SMA.java which contains Mapper , Reducer and Driver class.
	f) you will get output in your output directory.
	g) here i put my output file _user_vcslstudent_output0_part-r-00000 in simplemovingaveragemap-reduce folder.
